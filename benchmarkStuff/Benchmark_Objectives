BENCHMARK TRIALS FOR RNAMUTANTS

The benchmark is used to test how fast our solution works, and how good it is.
This is basically what Jerome wants for us to include in the proposal for the
Nucleic Acids Journal. So this is high priority...

We will be comparing our program with RNAMute:
http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~RNAMute/

PART I: CORRELATION BENCHMARK
Run simulations with these parameters:
	5 mutation sizes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
	2 sequences:
		HCV Wildtype:	AGCGGGGGAGACAUAUAUCACAGCCUGUCUCGUGCCCGACCCCGC
		HIV1 TAR Wildtype:	GGUCUCUCUGGUUAGACCAGAUCUGAGCCUGGGAGCUCUCUGGCUAACUAGAGAACC
	10 repeated runs per condition (to account for variance)
	2 programs: RNAmutants (ours) and RNAMute

So we have 5*2*10 = 100 runs for RNAmutants, and 100 runs for RNAMute
	
Record time and average correlation.
Average correlation = average of the output sequence correlations.
Keep min/max time and correlation of the 10 trials in each condition

Graph min/max for time and correlation.




PART II: SCALING BENCHMARK
Run simulations with these parameters:
	5 mutation sizes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
	5 sequence sizes: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100. Sequence to use: UGCCUGCCUCUUGGGAGGGG (double for 40, triple for 60, etc)
	10 trials per condition, (account for variance)
	2 programs: RNAmutants (ours) and RNAMute

So we have to do 5*5*10 = 250 runs of RNAmutants, and 250 runs of RNAMute

Record time and average correlation 
Keep min/max time and correlation of the 10 trials in each condition
Graph min/max for time and correlation.
