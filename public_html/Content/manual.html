<h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
<p> Step 1: Input an RNA sequence<br>
Step 2: Choose a heuristic method<br>
Step 3: Choose a search method (if applicable)<br>
Step 4: Modify extra options (optional)<br>
Step 5: Click Submit

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
CorRNA - Predict and analyze deleterious mutations
<p>CorRNA searches the mutational landscape for deleterious mutations. 
The program can use two different search algorithms (RNAMutants and FixedCGSampling)
as a base method for exploring the mutational landscape.
Two different search heuristics (structural and location) can also be used to refine the search.
The program will then ouput the mutations along with a correlation 
value and an optional significance value.
</p>

<h2>CONSTRAINT METHODS</h2>
<dl compact>
<dt><b>No Constraints</b></dt>
<dd>This option will run the algorithm without any structural or mutational 
heuristics and is useful to determine the effectiveness of the following
constraints methods.</dd>

<dt><b>Structure Heuristic</b></dt>
<dd>This heuristic uses structural constraints to guide the exploration
of the mutational landscape. CorRNA will first use the base pairing probability matrix
generated by RNAFold to find base pairing locations that are not used in 
optimal structure. The program will then run the search algorithm while 
constraining the search to mutations that would have this structure as their
optimal confirmation.
 </dd>

<dt><b>Mutation (location) Heuristic</b></dt>
<dd>This heuristic controls the locations at which mutations can occur in the sequence
CorRNA preform successive runs of the search algorithm and progressively
restricts locations along the sequence that have already been explored.</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Search Algorithm</h2>
<dl compact>
<dt><b>RNAmutants</b></dt>
<dd>This option runs the original RNAmutants algorithm</dd>

<dt><b>fixedCG Sampling</b></dt>
<dd>This option runs the novel algorithm which computes 
multiple mutations while preserving the G+C content of the wild sequence</dd>

<dt><b>Both</b></dt>
<dd>This option will run both RNAmutants and fixedCG Sampling</dd>

</dl>

<h2>ADDITIONAL OPTIONS</h2>
<dl compact>
<dt><b>Measure Significance of Deleterious Structure</b></dt>
<dd>This option runs a bootstrapping method where all mutations (single and multiple) 
are ranked according to their deleterious effect and their statistical significance is estimated. </dd>

<dt><b>RNAfold dangling end energies</b></dt>
<dd>This option allows you to control how RNAFold treats "dangling end" energies
for bases adjacent to helices in free ends and multi-loops. <br>
"With (-d1) only unpaired
bases can participate in at most one dangling end, this is the
default for mfe folding but unsupported for the partition function
folding. With <b>-d2</b> this check is ignored, dangling energies
will be added for the bases adjacent to a helix on both sides in
any case; this is the default for partition function folding (-p).
<b>-d</b> or <b>-d0</b> ignores dangling ends altogether (mostly
for debugging).<br> 
With <b>-d3</b> mfe folding will allow coaxial stacking of adjacent
helices in multi-loops. At the moment the implementation will not
allow coaxial stacking of the two interior pairs in a loop of
degree 3 and works only for mfe folding." (RNAFold Manpage)<br>

<h2>OUTPUT</h2>
A sortable table is displayed with the sequence mutation, mean free energy, 
optimal secondary structure, correlation coefficient of the 
structural ensemble, and statistical significance of the mutations. 
A web-link to the results is provided at the time of data submission 
which will report the status of the job. If the user provides an email 
address, this link and the results will also be sent by email.
