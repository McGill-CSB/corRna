	<b>Description</b>: Mutations modifying the native structure of RNA molecules are said to be deleterious.
Predicting these mutations is important because they can result in loss of the molecular function and to favor
the apparition of various diseases [1]. CorRNA is a web server for predicting deleterious in RNA molecules.
It uses the RNAmutants algorithm [2,3] to explore the RNA mutational landscape and implements two novel
strategies to guide this search and improve the quality of the results. Once computed, CorRNA analyzes the
predictions to evaluate the strength of the deleterious effect and estimate their statistical significance.	
        </p>
	
	<p><b>Input</b>: The user inputs a RNA sequence and (optionally) selects the methodology to perform the prediction.
	</p>

	<p><b>Processing method</b>: 
CorRNA works in two steps. First, CorRNA computes a sample set of candidate
deleterious mutations, and then, it ranks the samples by the strength of their deleterious effect. CorRNA
proposes two strategies to prune the RNA mutational landscape: A structural and a mutational heuristic. The
first strategy favors alternate structures already present in the suboptimal structural ensemble of the input
sequence. The second strategy performs successive runs of RNAmutants and progressively removes from
the sample set, mutations with a low deleterious effect. The deleterious effect is estimated by correlating the
base pairing probabilities of each sampled mutation sequence with the wild type, as described in [3]. Both
strategies can be combined together, or, if one wants to estimate the effectiveness of these methods, simply
omitted. Users can also choose between two algorithms to explore the mutational landscape. They can use
either the original RNAmutants algorithm [2] or a novel method to compute multiple mutations preserving
the G+C content of the wild sequence [3].<br>
In the second step, all mutations (single and multiple) are ranked according to their deleterious effect and
their statistical significance is estimated by a bootstrapping method. The latter compares the deleterious
effect of the candidate mutations to a set of randomly generated mutations.

	<p><b>Output</b>: 
A table is displayed with the sequence mutation, mean free energy, optimal secondary structure,
correlation coefficient of the structural ensemble, and statistical significance of the mutations. A web-link
to the results is provided at the time of data submission which will report the status of the job. If the user
provides an email address, this link and the results will also be sent by email.
