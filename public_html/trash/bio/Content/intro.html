	<b>Description</b>: Cor-RNA his web-server provides an unbiased way to 
	explore the RNA mutational landscape and a rank of the 
	deleterious nature of the predicted mutation sequences. 
	These two novel strategies use RNAmutants software [1] 
	and could be a valuable tool in predicting disease-associated 
	RNA mutations that may significantly alter RNA secondary structure.
        </p>
	
	<p><b>Input</b>: The user is asked to input a RNA sequence.
	 The user can then specify the way in which the application
	 will search through the RNA sequence mutation landscape.
	</p>

	<p><b>Processing method</b>: The first application uses a new 
	method for probing the RNA mutation landscape. This method involves 
	using RNAmutants to fix the C and G nucleotide content of the 
	sequence when probing the RNA mutation landscape [2]. The second 
	strategy measures the .deleterious-ness. of the secondary structure 
	of a mutation sequence when compared to its wildtype. This was done 
	by correlating the Boltzman partition function of base pairing 
	probabilities of each sampled mutation sequence with the wild-type,
	 as described in [3]. Finally, the significance of the predicted 
	mutation sequences was analyzed by a bootstrapping method. This 
	method compared the deleterious nature of the candidate mutation 
	sequence a set of randomly generated mutation sequences to which 
	the aforementioned correlation method has been applied.
	</p>


	<p><b>Output</b>: A table is displayed with the sequence mutation, 
	mean free energy, optimal secondary structure, correlation value 
	and significance. A web-link to the results is provided at the 
	time of data submission which will report the status of the job. 
	If the user provides an email address, this link and the results 
	will also be sent by email.
