RNAMute is an application that provides a user friendly interface for analyzing the effects of point mutations on RNAs secondary structure.
As with proteins, mutations in RNAs have the potential to alter their functionality 
in important biological processes.
When attempting to develop models for the prediction of conformational 
rearranging 
mutations in RNAs, useful structural information is available from folding 
algorithms that predict the secondary structure of RNAs based on energy 
minimization. 
Detecting mutations with desirable structural effects among all possible point 
mutations may then be valuable for the prediction of selective mutations that 
can be tested experimentally. The mutation prediction method is independent of the folding algorithms but relies on 
their success to predict the folding of small RNA structures. 
For convenience in this work, we chose to use the Vienna RNA package for the prediction and comparison of RNA secondary 
structures. The Vienna package already contains several utilities that are 
related to this work and can be used as building blocks in our mutation predictions. </span></p>

The Package Content</h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 150%" align="left">
    <span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Times New Roman">

1. mute_single - performs all possible 
&quot;single point mutations&quot; in an RNA sequence. It predicts the secondary 
structure of the wild type and mutants using Vienna's RNAfold, then calculates 
several different representations and similarity measures between the wild type 
and mutants, and finally produces a &quot;result&quot; file from the results obtained. 
	<p style="line-height: 150%">

2. RNAmute.java - the main routine. Creates a &quot;friendly&quot; interface for the user. Receives 
as input&nbsp;a&nbsp;file with an RNA sequence, runs
&quot;mute_single&quot;, and generates an HTML file 
&quot;<span dir="LTR">RESULT_TABLE.html</span><span lang="HE"> </span>
&quot; that contains all the processed&nbsp;data from the &quot;result&quot; file organized in 
various tables. 
	<p style="line-height: 150%">

3. calcEig2 - calculates the second smallest eigenvalue of the
Laplacian matrix for each single point mutation.<p style="line-height: 150%">

4. b2Shapiro - converts the full structure from bracket notation to the weighted 
coarse grained notation introduced by Bruce Shapiro. This routine uses a function 
that is located in the Vienna package's &quot;lib&quot; directory. <p style="line-height: 150%">

5. runRnaMute - similar to RNAmute, but enables the user to insert the RNA sequence 
in a text area of the GUI instead of using a file.

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
1. RNAfold - predicts minimum energy secondary structures and base pairing probabilities.<br><br>
2. RNAdistance - calculates the distance between two RNA secondary structures

&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Times New Roman">
The package also contains the source code for all its components. <br></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%" align="left">

Preparation and Compilation

<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
RNAMute can run only on a Linux platform, so all preparations and compilations that will be 
mentioned should be performed on a Linux platform with Java and &quot;GNU CC&quot; compiler 
installed. RNAMute has all its components already compiled and may be used 
without any compilations as described in the &quot;<b>How to Run the Program</b>&quot; 
part, but it has some components written in C that in some architectures may 
not work. In such a case, the Vienna RNA package should be downloaded from the web 
at <a href="http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/">http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/</a>
and directory &quot;ViennaRNA-1.4\lib&quot; should be compiled by running the command 
&quot;make&quot; in this directory. All files from the directory &quot;RNAMute\RNAMute_progs&quot; 
should be copied to &quot;ViennaRNA-1.4\Progs&quot; and compiled with &quot;makefile&quot;. 
&quot;Makefile&quot; that appears in the &quot;ViennaRNA-1.4\Progs&quot; directory should be overwritten. After the 
compilation finishes, files: &quot;b2Shapiro&quot;, &quot;calcEig2&quot;, &quot;RNAdistance&quot;, &quot;RNAfold&quot; 
and &quot;mute_single&quot; should be copied from
&quot;ViennaRNA-1.4\Progs&quot; directory to the &quot;RNAMute\bin&quot; 
directory. All files that are already in it should be overwritten. Make sure that 
all files in the &quot;RNAMute\bin&quot; directory are in 
an executable mode. If not, change their mode by typing the command:&nbsp; &gt;chmod 700 
file_name ,when file_name is each file&nbsp; from the list above. At this point, the 
RNAMute package can be used as described in the &quot;<b>How to Run the Program</b>&quot; 
part. &nbsp;<span dir="RTL">&nbsp;</span></span> <br>

How to Run the Program</h2>


<p style="line-height: 150%">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Times New Roman">
Before running the program make sure that all the <a href="#Preparation &amp; Compilation">
preparations</a> are done.<br>Open a Unix shell, and go to the directory that holds the 
program (e.g. ~/RNAMute).<br> The RNAMute program can be executed in two ways:<br>
1. With Graphical User Interface (GUI) : 
<ul><li>type the command:<br> 
>java -jar runRnaMute.jar</li></ul>
 </span></p>


<p style="line-height: 150%">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; The GUI that appears 
after running the command looks like this:<p style="line-height: 150%">
<IMG border="0" src=pic/RNAmute_input_screen.jpg width="500" height="300"></span></p>


<p style="line-height: 150%">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At this point, an RNA sequence may be inserted into the text box of the GUI. 
<br>
<ul><li> The &quot;Reset&quot; button 
removes the sequence from the text area.</li> 
<li>To start a calculation the &quot;Start&quot; button 
should be pressed. </li>
<li>During the calculation the &quot;Start&quot; button remains pressed and after the calculation stops, 
the &quot;Start&quot; button releases&nbsp;(please be patient as it may 
take a few seconds to generate the results).</li>
<li>Results may be observed by pressing the &quot;Result&quot; button.</li> 
If the file could not be opened by pressing the &quot;Result&quot; button, open the file &quot;RESULT_TABLE.html&quot;, which is located in the 
same directory (e.g.~/RNAMute).</li></ul></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Times New Roman">
2. Without Graphical User Interface (GUI) :</br>
<ul><li>Type your sequence in a  file (e.g., my_seq).</li>
<li>Save this file in the same directory where the program resides (e.g. ~/RNAMute)</li>
<li>From this directory, run the program &quot;RNAmute&quot;, with the sequence file as an argument. Use this command:<br>
 &gt; java&nbsp;&nbsp; -jar RNAmute.jar &nbsp; my_seq</li>
<li>Wait until the application terminates (it may take a few seconds).</li>
<li>A new file &quot;RESULT_TABLE.html&quot; will appear in the current 
directory (e.g.&nbsp; ~/RNAMute). To examine the output, open the file and follow 
its links. </li></ul></span></p>

First of all, make sure that all the <a href="#Preparation &amp; Compilation">preparations</a> were performed and all the 
<a href="#Requirements">requirements</a>&nbsp;have been fulfilled.
</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Times New Roman">
If one of the single point mutations results in a
completely linear structure (i.e., a single strand with no base
pairing), the "Dot-bracket table" may not be generated and an
exception error may appear. In such a case, inspect the "Eigenvalue table"
and verify that indeed one of the mutations is causing a single strand.
</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Times New Roman">
If you have some problems running the program with the Graphical Interface, try to run it 
without. For instructions go to <a href="#How to run the program">&quot;How to run the Program&quot;</a>.
